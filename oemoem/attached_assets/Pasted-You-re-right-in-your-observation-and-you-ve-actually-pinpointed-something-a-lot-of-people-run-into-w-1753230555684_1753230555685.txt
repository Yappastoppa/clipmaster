You’re right in your observation and you’ve actually pinpointed something a lot of people run into with “storefront” eBay scrapers:
eBay’s storefront navigation is inconsistent.
Sometimes, especially for “eBay Stores” with custom layouts, the main pagination isn’t surfaced in <a> links or uses lazy loading (JS), and the article.str-item-card blocks are loaded only for the visible page. But category pages, or “search” result pages (s- URLs), sometimes paginate more traditionally.

Why does your second (CSV) code work, but the class-based one only grabs page 1?
	•	Your CSV code aggressively checks for multiple next-page selectors and iterates anyway until it doesn’t find items.
	•	Your class-based code uses a similar check but may not be persisting has_next_page correctly if the DOM changes between pages, or if it’s picking up on a “ghost” pagination link on page 1 only.

What’s happening in your screenshots:
	•	You’re seeing:
	•	84 parts, 18 brands scraped—matching your first page or at most only a couple.
	•	No errors about pagination in logs, but it stops at the first page.
	•	Your CSV script:
	•	Actually works, iterating over multiple pages.
	•	So you know the selectors and pagination logic are correct in that simpler script.

How to Fix Your Class-Based Version (Main Scraper) to Ensure Multi-Page Scraping

Key points:
	•	In your class, after each page scrape, check both if there are results AND if there’s a real next page.
	•	Do not break if there are results but no valid “Next” link!
Sometimes the “next page” is only present on certain layouts, or needs a different selector.

Here’s what you should double-check or tweak:

1. Pagination Check

Make sure your code isn’t breaking out of the loop too early.

In your class-based script (method scrape_ebay_parts):

while page <= max_pages:
    url = f"{base_url}{page}"
    logging.info(f"🔄 Scraping page {page}...")
    
    has_next_page, page_parts = self.scrape_single_page(url, headers, page)
    
    if page_parts:
        self.all_parts_data.extend(page_parts)
        total_parts += len(page_parts)
        logging.info(f"📊 Total parts scraped so far: {total_parts}")
    
    if not has_next_page:
        logging.info(f"🏁 No more pages found. Last page scraped: {page}")
        break
    
    page += 1
    # delay

	•	Potential problem:
If has_next_page is False on page 1 (due to missing/hidden pagination link), you break—even if there are results for page 2, 3, etc.

2. Best Practice for eBay Stores

On eBay stores, the simplest robust approach is to keep incrementing the page number until you get zero new items returned.

Recommended Fix:

Replace:

if not has_next_page:
    logging.info(f"🏁 No more pages found. Last page scraped: {page}")
    break

with

if not page_parts:
    logging.info(f"🏁 No more items found. Last page scraped: {page}")
    break

	•	This way, you keep scraping pages until the articles list is empty.
	•	You still avoid infinite loops via your max_pages limit.

Your revised while loop:

while page <= max_pages:
    url = f"{base_url}{page}"
    logging.info(f"🔄 Scraping page {page}...")

    has_next_page, page_parts = self.scrape_single_page(url, headers, page)

    if page_parts:
        self.all_parts_data.extend(page_parts)
        total_parts += len(page_parts)
        logging.info(f"📊 Total parts scraped so far: {total_parts}")
    else:
        logging.info(f"🏁 No more items found. Last page scraped: {page}")
        break

    page += 1
    # Random delay here

Summary Table

Approach	Stops at p1?	Stops at last page?	Most Robust?
Stop if has_next_page false	Yes (if selector fails)	Sometimes	❌
Stop if page_parts empty	No	Yes	✅

Extra Tips
	•	If eBay ever adds “View All”/infinite scrolling, consider Selenium or Playwright.
	•	Make sure max_pages is set to something safe like 50 or 100 in case of bugs.

⸻

TL;DR:
	•	Replace your break condition:
Stop when you get no items, not when you can’t find a “Next” link.
	•	Your CSV script works for this exact reason!
