Here's a comprehensive prompt to generate a fully functional shopping cart and checkout system with payment integration:

---

**Prompt for AI:**
"Create a responsive e-commerce shopping cart and checkout system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Stripe for payments. Implement the following components:

1. **Product Display Page**  
   - Grid of products with image, name, price  
   - 'Add to Cart' button for each product  
   - Cart icon badge showing item count  

2. **Shopping Cart Features**  
   - LocalStorage persistence  
   - Add/remove items  
   - Update quantities  
   - Calculate:  
     • Subtotal  
     • Tax (10%)  
     • Shipping ($5 flat)  
     • Grand total  

3. **Checkout Process**  
   - Form with:  
     • Shipping address  
     • Billing address (with 'same as shipping' toggle)  
     • Contact information  
   - Payment section using Stripe Elements  
   - Real-time validation  

4. **Payment Integration**  
   - Stripe test mode with card element  
   - Handle payment submission  
   - Error handling for declined payments  

5. **Order Confirmation**  
   - Success page with:  
     • Order summary  
     • Tracking number  
     • Customer support info  

**Technical Requirements:**  
- Mobile-responsive design  
- ES6 JavaScript with modular code  
- Stripe.js (test mode) with card validation  
- Error handling for all user actions  
- LocalStorage for cart persistence  
- No backend required (mock order processing)  

**Mock Product Data:**  
```javascript
const products = [
  {id: 1, name: "Wireless Headphones", price: 89.99, image: "headphones.jpg"},
  {id: 2, name: "Smartphone Case", price: 24.95, image: "case.jpg"},
  {id: 3, name: "USB-C Charger", price: 19.99, image: "charger.jpg"}
];
```

**Implementation Notes:**  
1. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`  
2. Tax = 10% of subtotal  
3. Shipping = $5 flat rate  
4. Generate random order ID on confirmation  

**Output:** Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS or separate files if preferred. Ensure clean, commented code."
