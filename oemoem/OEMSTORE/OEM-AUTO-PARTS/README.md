# OEM Auto Parts Data

This folder stores all data generated by the inventory refresh scripts.

## Usage

- **Full refresh**: `python master_refresh.py` scrapes the eBay store and generates
  `combined_listing.csv`, `grouped_by_vin.csv`, `donor_car.csv`, and `inventory.json`.
  You can limit scraping for quicker tests by calling
  `scrape_ebay_parts(max_pages=<number>)` within the script.
- **Quick test**: `python page1_refresh.py` runs the refresh pipeline but only
  scrapes the first page of listings.
- **Testing**: After refreshing, run `python test_workflow.py` to validate the
  output files.
- **Serving**: Launch `python server.py` to start the local Flask server and view
  the store website.
